# Flite rpm for Fedora 18

Here are specs and prebuilt RPMs for x86_64 architecture for [Flite](http://www.cmuflite.org) version 1.4 to use with Fedora 18 and (probably) onwards.

## Installation

As usual:

    yum localinstall flite-1.4-r1.fc18.R.x86_64.rpm

Or you can rebuild it, for example, i686, if you really need it.
